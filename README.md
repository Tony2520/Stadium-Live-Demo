# Stadium Live Demo: My work for the past year:

If you want to check out the app -> https://www.stadiumverse.com/

Stadium Live is a rising betting/fantasy mobile app with around 3 Million total downloads with 200K daily active users. I've spent over a year (3 internships) helping to build the new playground for Gen Z Sports fans. With an engineering team of 8, I hit the ground running and independently shipped multiple complex, end-to-end features. Below are 6 of the most noteworthy ones.

## Project #1: Challenges System üéØ

**Summary:**
As a main goal of 2024 growth initiatives, we needed a loop that incentivizes users to log in **every day** and engage in the core staking action. I designed and built a scalable, dynamic, and personalized Daily Challenge architecture that spearheaded this goal

### Demo

**Backend:**

- OOP driven architecture with 20+ challenge subclasses
- Multi-table normalized DB with <100ms query performance using retention policies and indexes
- Scalable scheduling design: batch job for active users + on-demand message queues for new users.
- Async progression handling 10M+ daily actions
- Personalized challenges based on user behavior & preferences

**Frontend:**

- Snappy UI with Animation
- Deep linking for seamless challenge completion
- A/B tested entry points for optimal coverage

**Impact:**

- üìà Increased DAU retention by 5%, surpassing original retention goal of 2%
- üî• "Rate us" challenge generated 80% spike in users leaving an app review, taking our app to the #1 growing sports app chart within days --> unexpected major win, gained substential visibility
- üí∞ Based on user popularity, this was one of the first features chosen to be included in our monetization initiatives --> Got us our first bucket for gold

## Project #2: Personalized Stakes üí∏

### Summary

One of the biggest pivots we took in 2023 is the addition of competitive sports betting, which internally we called Stakes. With the initial betting feature set up, there were two issues:

1. Lack of personalization. Daily stakes were static for all users across the board, which is quite constraining for our users consisting of a diverse sports fan base
2. Lack of automation. Content team had to manually enable stakes daily, which was a tedious process

I built a complex recommendation engine to solve both problems. At its core, this engine scores and ranks all available stakes against a user's preferences based on their favorite players, teams, and leagues, and predicts the top personalized stakes for a given user

In addition to the user preference scoring, the engine consists of many more factors such as:

- Game virality
- League variety
- Time decay
- Star Player Wildcard
- Seed randomization

### Demo

<div style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <table style="width: 100%">
    <tr>
        <th style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">NBA Fan</th>
        <th style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">NHL Fan</th>
        <th style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">I love all sports</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td ><img src="Stakes/nba.gif" alt="nba stakes" loop=infinite></td>
        <td ><img src="Stakes/nhl.gif" alt="nhl stakes" loop=infinite></td>
        <td ><img src="Stakes/mixed.gif" alt="mixed stakes" loop=infinite></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

### Impact

- üéØ The pivot ended up being very successful‚Äî-we are now a fully sports betting app. To this day, the engine I built powers our core user experience on our landing page and throughout the app

### Challenges and Learnings

- Ambiguity. It was very hard to generalize a one-size-fits-all experience for our broad user base‚Äîeven the Product team wasn't quite sure. It took a lot of iterations and feedback from our core users to get the tuning right
- Really stretched my SQL knowledge. Delved into tons of PostgreSQL docs to achieve some of the behaviors mentioned above
- Many timezone-based edge cases to consider such as answered stakes, pending stakes, missed stakes, and delayed stakes
- Learned and applied advanced SQL tools such as PostgreSQL performance indexes and nested window functions

## Project #3: User Profile Revampüì±

### Summary

The old profile has not been touched up since a year ago -- ancient history for a startup. The goal of the revamp is to give it a more slick and thematic design along with 3 objectives in mind

- Increase in Virality (Share rate)
- Set up as the main entry point for the upcoming monetization expansion
- Allow users for a more personalized skill expression (favorites, collectibles, win rates, etc)

|          New Profile          |          Old Profile          |
| :---------------------------: | :---------------------------: |
| ![](Profiles/profile_new.png) | ![](Profiles/profile_old.png) |

### Features

- Refactored old profile queries using GraphQL batching and caching for speedy performance gains

<div style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <table style="width: 100%">
    <tr>
        <th style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">Animated scrolling/loading components</th>
        <th style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">Faves editing and player profiles</th>
        <th style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">Badges collection</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td ><img src="Profiles/intro.gif" alt="Profile Demo"></td>
        <td ><img src="Profiles/faves.gif" alt="Faves gif"></td>
        <td ><img src="Profiles/badges.gif" alt="Badges gif"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">Paginated collectibles list & animated slider</th>
        <th style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">Paginated friends profiles</th>
        <th style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">Avatar items list view with outfit preview</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style=><img src="Profiles/collectibles.gif" alt="Collectibles gif"></td>
        <td style=><img src="Profiles/friends.gif" alt="Friends gif"></td>
        <td style=><img src="Profiles/items.gif" alt="Items gif"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

### Challenges and Learnings

- Lots of net new components to build out. Volume wise easily the beefiest front-end feature I'd had to build
- Animation is fun but hard. Lots of sleep lost on timing the animation parts (username scrollY, profile pic shrink, background blur) in sync with each other so that it all looks like a single
  seamless scroll
- Definitely a challenge trying to make React animation work properly on both iOS and Android

## Project #4: Squad 2.0 üéÆ

### Summaries

Major expansion on our clan-like multiplayer mode Squad

### Features

<div style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <table style="width: 100%">
    <tr>
        <th style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">Private/Global Squad leaderboard</th>
        <th style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">Squad weekly challenges and rewards</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td ><img src="Squads/leaderboards.gif" alt="Squads Leaderboards" loop=infinite></td>
        <td ><img src="Squads/challenge.gif" alt="Squads Challenges" loop=infinite></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">Paginated squad chats with profiles</th>
        <th style="width: 33%; text-align: center;">Skill-based squads matching & animated squad card</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style=><img src="Squads/paginatedChats.gif" alt="Squads Chats" loop=infinite></td>
        <td style=><img src="Squads/matchmaking.gif" alt="Squads LandingPage" loop=infinite></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

### Challenges and Learnings

- This was my first major project after ramp up. Took some stumbles but learned many interesting things like end-to-end deployment methods and backward compatibility
- First time working with real-time data as we use Firebase pub/sub for our chat, quite a powerful tool
- Handling squad join/leave end-to-end flow could be tricky at times. Learned a lot about thinking in different perspectives in terms of clients vs server

## Project #5: Player Mentions üèÄ

### Summaries

Added player/user lookup & mention functionality into chatbox with suggestion preview, auto-complete, and player profile routing

### Demo

<img src="Mentions/mention.gif" alt="Squads Chats" loop=infinite>

### Challenges and Learnings

This nimble-looking feature was particularly hard for multiple reasons

1. React doesn't support rich text editor natively, to achieve in-place auto-complete I had to add some complex string parsing and manipulation in our own text editor
2. For the mention popup to feel reactive upon input change, backend player lookup has to be near instantaneous
3. Non-distinct player names require extra data to be packaged and stored on the backend. Adding encode/decode structure everywhere in the codebase is a pretty big undertaking
4. Backward compatibility is a pain to work with from 3). Sanitization had to be added everywhere to ensure no weirdness for returning users

Learnings:

1. Learned and implemented debounced fuzzy search and GIN indexes used for speedy player lookup on the backend
2. Hacked together a mini rich text editor to highlight and in-place auto-complete player names on the frontend
